# ConversoAI 🧠💬  
*A lightweight AI-powered chat interface built using Streamlit and LangChain with Groq LLM support.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

ConversoAI is an interactive AI chat application that allows users to communicate with modern LLMs powered by the **Groq API**.  
Built using **Streamlit** and **LangChain**, the app provides a clean UI where users can:

- Enter their Groq API key securely
- Select from available LLM models
- Control temperature and token settings
- Ask natural language questions and receive responses instantly

This project is ideal for learning how to connect LLMs with UI frameworks and understanding how LangChain manages prompt pipelines.
